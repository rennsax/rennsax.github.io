Hi! 👋🏻 I'm an undergraduate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University with a passion for the open-source community. I'm engaged in scholarly pursuits at [IPADS](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/), the institute of parallel and distributed systems.

Current academic interests:

- Runtime system
- Programming language
- DNN compiler

I'm proficient in:

- C/C++
- Python
- Linux Ops

I'm good at:

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript/TypeScript
- GoLang
- Rust

More useless skills 🙂:

- Emacs
- Nix (I'm maintaining some packages in [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs)!)
- Scheme
- Haskell
- (You've probably seen... I'm a Lisp lover!)
